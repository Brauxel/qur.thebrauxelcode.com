Embed responsive YouTube or Vimeo videos in pages, posts, or even the "text" widget using a super-simple shortcode.

== Description ==

Features Include:

*    The ability to add one or more videos directly in to a page, post or any of your own custom post types using the video URL (not the embed code) or ID and a short code. Currently YouTube and Vimeo are supported, using the [responsive_youtube] and [responsive_vimeo] shortcodes, respectively.
*    Fully responsive so the video's viewport will fill the width of the containing area and scale depending on screen size. No need to set a width and height, just set the width of the div your content sits in.
*    YouTube videos have a shortcode attribute that lets you turn "related videos" on or off. "Related Videos" are the links that tile across the viewport when a video has completed playing.
*    YouTube videos also support light and dark themes, autoplaying, showinfo, and modest branding (which removes most YouTube brand imagery).
*    Vimeo videos can have the video portrait, title, and byline shut off.
*    A comprehensive settings screen which explains all the options and shows you the syntax of the shortcodes.

Example Usage:

For a YouTube video, you can specify either full URL to the video or just the unique video ID, or the YouTube sharing or embed URLs, like this:

    [responsive_youtube http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbCr0UyoFJA ]
    [responsive_youtube NbCr0UyoFJA]
    [responsive_youtube https://youtu.be//NbCr0UyoFJA ]
    [responsive_youtube https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbCr0UyoFJA ]

And if you want to specify whether or not you'd like the "related videos" to display, you can use the "rel" or "norel" parameters in the shortcode syntax, like this:

    [responsive_youtube NbCr0UyoFJA norel]
    [responsive_youtube NbCr0UyoFJA rel]

The rel and norel tags will override whatever you have set in the plugin settings screen for that specific video only.

Similarly, for a Vimeo video, you can use the full video player URL or just the video ID, like this:

    [responsive_vimeo https://vimeo.com/29506088 ]
    [responsive_vimeo 29506088]

There is a more complete treatment of the shortcode syntax in the settings screen of the plugin itself.

= Requirements =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Says wrong video id or no video shows =

Make sure you have copied the main URL from your address bar for the video and not the supplied embed code.

Make sure you have selected the correct video type. If Vimeo is selected but a YouTube URL is pasted (or vice versa), it will not work.

If this is a Vimeo video, ensure you have permission for the video to be embedded. You may have to contact the video owner to get this.

= Video is not resizing =

Make sure that the div or other block-level element that contains the video has a width set and that it is a percentage and not a fixed width.

= YouTube videos are displaying in front of a part of my HTML =

Check out the wmode options in the plugin documentation.  Chances are that
setting it to "transparent" will fix the problem.
